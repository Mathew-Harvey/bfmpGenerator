# bfmpGenerator
This code provides a fully client-side solution for generating a Biofouling Management Plan (BFMP). Users fill out a two-column form, optionally upload a vessel photo, and instantly receive a print-ready document built via Handlebars.js. The final BFMP includes inspection schedules, record-keeping templates, and is truly serverless, for compliance.
